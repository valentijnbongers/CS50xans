Description:
My final project for the CS50 course will be based around a concept called Webscraping. In which I will extract data from a chosen website
using the 'requests' and 'beautiful soup 4' libraries. I will use the information from the scrape to format it into a array of dictionaries.
I have also included an option to export the scraped data to an excel file sheet if the user wants to view the raw data. My plan is to then
display my results on a webpage of my own. My website will incluce a trivia section. Here, a multiple choice question will be randomly
generated. Eg. What is the capital of the USA. (options). The user will then click 1 of 4 given options. if correct, points are awarded and
another question is given. If incorrect, points are displayed and the round is ended. I will create a highscores tab, containing the 10
highest streaks obtained by users. stored in an sql database. This project is an amazing test of my skills and a way for me to step out
of my comfort zone and try concepts I am unfamiliar with. Concepts strengthened: webscraping, HTML and website building, Database
management, algorithmic and logical thinking to write the underlying code, creativity to design the site and project. Webscraping was a
concept mostly unfamiliar to me; i had seen it once before during a one month internship and was interested in developing it to see what
other things i could do with this skill. CS50, to me, was the perfect chance to develop this and I think it worked out great. I also chose
this because I assume not many other people are gonna do something based around webscraping as its a pretty unknown, but underrated, topic.
List: displays a list of all data I used. contains one table with the headers: Country, Capital, Population, and Area. This section allows
searching for country name or captital as well as sorting, alphabetically, the country name or capital; or, in descending order, the
population or area. Trivia: First displays a list of options/gamemodes that can be played: Capitals, Populations, Areas. For each one
of these, a country is randomly chosen from the Array + 4 options of (eg.) capitals. One of these will be the correct answer. Clicking
the correct one will send you to the next question, adding to the counter/score. Clicking the wrong one will end the run and display
the correct answer, and the score obtained. A name can then be inputted to be added to the highscores leaderboard Highscores: Shows a
table of 10 rows. Each row shows the name and score of the 10 highest scores ever obtained. It is grouped by gamemode so at the top
a gamemode can be selected and the top 10 will be displayed for that gamemode.
